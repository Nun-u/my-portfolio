# my-portfolio
A minimalist mobile-first portfolio developed simply with HTML/CSS/JS. Simplicity isn't always worse!

## Can I use this for my own portfolio?
Sure! Just provide a link to the repository somewhere in your website/repository so other people can also use it :)

## How do I use it?
1. Fork the repository into your own.
2. Edit the index.html with your info.
3. Use a SASS compiler like Prepros for all the SCSS and JS files.

*Wow how easy is it when you aren't using a million frameworks hehe!*

## What's next?
- Don't know to be honest! Hoping to keep it a simple one-pager, so don't want to bulk it up much more...
