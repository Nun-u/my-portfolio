# my-portfolio
A minimalist mobile-first portfolio developed simply with HTML/CSS/JS. Simplicity isn't always worse!

## Can I use this for my own portfolio?
Sure! Just provide a link to the repository somewhere in your website/repository so other people can also use it :)

## How do I use it?
1. Fork the repository into your own.
2. Edit the index.html with your info.

*Wow how easy is it when you aren't using a million frameworks hehe!*

## What's next?
- I'll probably look into adding a datastore of some sort for all info, that way it can be more easily customized!
- Maybe some other pages: blog, more in-depth projects info, idk
